Here is the case study information I used for this SDD...

As the largest provider of nonprofit higher education in the country,
Southern New Hampshire University has their work cut out for them.
They need to support more than 240,000 users, including 130,000
online students, 3,000 on-campus students, 4,000 on-campus faculty
and staff, 6,000 remote faculty and staff, and 100,000 alumni. And they
need to do it all while meeting the internal business units’ very high
expectations for user satisfaction and customer experience.
As the front line for all technical support, the SNHU Technology Help
Desk team needs to manage an unpredictable volume of requests.
They may receive 100 requests one day and 200 the next, especially
during key events like the start of a new term. And they need to do it
in a way that meets the needs of an increasingly modern user base.
For example, SNHU employees and students don’t want to pick up
the phone when they need IT help. They expect technical support to
be just as quick as other communications they’re accustomed to, like
texting, which adds another layer of expectations to meet.
